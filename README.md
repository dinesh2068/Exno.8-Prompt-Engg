# Aim: 
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
# üß† Prompting Procedure

## üéµ Start Simple
Use basic prompts for music/voice generation (genre, mood, tempo).

## üß± Add Layers
Incorporate structured prompts for multi-element audio (background/foreground sounds).

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Control
Apply conditional logic for dynamic audio (interactive/adaptive outputs).

## üéöÔ∏è Manipulate & Enhance
Use AI for remixing, stem separation, and spatial audio design.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimize
Refine outputs via iterative prompting and technical constraints (BPM, key, format).

# üéß Basic to Advanced Audio Generation Prompt

## 1. üéµ Basic Audio Generation Prompts

### Music Composition

**Prompt Template:**
```
Compose a 30-second [genre] track with [mood/energy level].  
Include [specific instruments/elements].  
Tempo should be [BPM range].  
Key signature: [key].
```

**Example Output (JSON):**
```json
{
  "description": "Upbeat electronic track with pulsating bass and arpeggiated synths",
  "bpm": 128,
  "key": "D minor",
  "structure": "8-bar intro, 16-bar main section, 8-bar outro",
  "instruments": ["Kick drum", "Snare", "Hi-hats", "Sub bass", "Lead synth"]
}
```

### Voice Narration

**Prompt Template:**
```
Generate a voice narration with these characteristics:
- Text: [your script]
- Gender: [male/female/neutral]
- Age: [young/adult/elderly]
- Accent: [specific accent]
- Pace: [words per minute]
- Emotion: [emotional tone]
```

## 2. üéö Intermediate Prompting Techniques

### Layered Audio Construction

```python
audio_prompt = """ 
Create a layered audio scene with these components:
1. Background: City park atmosphere (birds, distant chatter)
2. Foreground: 
   - Main character footsteps (gravel path)
   - Occasional dog bark
3. Emotional tone: Peaceful morning
4. Duration: 45 seconds
5. Dynamic range: Wide (quiet moments to louder events)
"""
```

### Musical Style Transfer

**Prompt Example:**
```
Transform this classical piano piece (attach MIDI/file) into:
- Style: Afrobeat
- New tempo: 110 BPM
- Additional instruments: Brass section, percussion
- Key change: Up a major third
- Add syncopated rhythms
```

---

## 3. üß† Advanced Prompting Strategies

### Conditional Audio Generation

```python
conditional_prompt = """ 
Generate background music that adapts to these scene parameters:
- When protagonist is exploring: Mysterious, ambient pads
- During action sequences: Fast-paced percussion with rising tension
- In emotional moments: Soft piano with string accents
- Transition smoothly between these states
Provide separate audio stems for each element.
"""
```

### Interactive Audio System

**Prompt Design:**
```
Create an interactive audio system that responds to:
1. Input: User's heart rate (simulated)
   - <60 bpm: Calm, spacious textures
   - 60-100 bpm: Rhythmic pulse
   - >100 bpm: Intense, driving beats
2. Time of day:
   - Morning: Bright, ascending melodies
   - Night: Deep, resonant tones
3. Weather conditions (API input):
   - Sunny: Major key, cheerful
   - Rainy: Minor key, rhythmic droplets

Output should blend these parameters in real-time.
```

        audio = self.music_model.generate([prompt])
        return audio[0].cpu().numpy()

    def generate_voice(self, text, voice_params):
        response = self.voice_client.audio.speech.create(

            input=text,
            speed=voice_params.get('speed', 1.0)
        )
        return response.content

    def remix_audio(self, prompt, audio_input):
        analysis_prompt = f"""
        Analyze this audio and suggest modifications:
        {prompt}
        Current audio features:
        - Duration: {audio_input.duration} seconds
        - Sample rate: {audio_input.sample_rate} Hz
        - Channels: {audio_input.channels}
        """
        analysis = self._get_ai_feedback(analysis_prompt)
        return self._apply_audio_transforms(audio_input, analysis)

    def create_soundscape(self, scene_description):
        prompt = f"""
        Break down this soundscape into individual components:
        {scene_description}

        Return JSON with:
        - background_elements
        - foreground_elements
        - mixing_instructions
        """
        design = self._get_structured_output(prompt)
        return self._render_soundscape(design)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generator = AudioGenerator({
        'openai': 'your-openai-key',
        'elevenlabs': 'your-elevenlabs-key'
    })

    meditation_audio = generator.generate_music(
        "Calming meditation music with singing bowls and nature sounds, 60 BPM",
        duration=300
    )
    sf.write('meditation.wav', meditation_audio, 44100)

    voiceover = generator.generate_voice(
        "Welcome to our audio journey through the rainforest",
        {'voice': 'echo', 'speed': 0.9}
    )
    with open('voiceover.mp3', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(voiceover)

## üéº Specialized Prompting Techniques

### Emotional Arc Construction

```
Compose a musical piece that follows this emotional journey:
1. Opening: Uncertainty (dissonant chords)
2. Build: Growing confidence (rising melody)
3. Climax: Triumph (full orchestration)
4. Resolution: Peaceful resolution (resolving to major key)
Use harmonic tension and instrumentation to convey this progression.

```
### Output For The Above Prompt
```
[Verse]
Fingers trace the line of doubt
In shadows where dreams twist and shout
A world of gray the heart won't claim
The winds of fear whisper my name

[Verse 2]
A spark ignites in the empty space
A fragile flame begins its race
Through winding paths of risk and gain
The pulse quickens beneath the strain

[Chorus]
Rise and rise the melody flies
Breaking through the heavy skies
Drums of courage beat so strong
A symphony where I belong

[Bridge]
Strings collide in a burst of light
Horns declare the final fight
The walls collapse the chains dissolve
The answer's clear the soul evolves

[Chorus]
Rise and rise the melody flies
Breaking through the heavy skies
Drums of courage beat so strong
A symphony where I belong

[Outro]
The tide recedes the waters calm
A quiet hum a healing balm
Peaceful echoes drift and fade
In the stillness my heart is laid
```

2. Apply compression to even out vocal dynamics
3. Enhance speech clarity (preset: broadcast)
4. Remove mouth clicks and breaths
5. Maintain natural timbre
Output processed file and settings report.
```

### Spatial Audio Design

```
Create 3D audio environment with:
- Sound sources at these positions:
  - Bird: 30¬∞ left, elevated

- HRTF processing for headphones
- Distance cues for depth
- Optional: Ambisonics output
Provide binaural and multichannel versions.
```

## üß∞ Best Practices for Audio Prompting

### Precision in Description
- Use musical terms like BPM, key, instrumentation
- Reference known styles or artists for tone/genre guidance

### Structural Guidance
- Define intro, body, outro
- Specify duration for each section

### Technical Constraints
- Mention sample rate, channels, format (e.g., 24-bit WAV)

### Reference Tracks
- ‚ÄúThe energy of Track A but with instrumentation of Track B‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSimilar vibe to [artist]'s [song], but more‚Ä¶‚Äù

### Iterative Refinement
1. Generate base version  
2. Request specific changes  
3. Ask for stems for deeper mixing
